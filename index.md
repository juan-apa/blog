I'm a Software Engineer from Montevideo, Uruguay. I've been programming in Ruby and Rails for the past 5 years now, having worked in different software agencies and startups.



Currently, I'm working as an Engineering Manager at [GoGrow](https://gogrow.dev), where I lead and mentor a team of other passionate Rails developers.
